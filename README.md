3. Abstract

This project focuses on the comprehensive design and analysis of a thermal system, emphasizing heat transfer processes, system efficiency, and optimization. Thermal systems are critical in power generation, heating, cooling, and industrial manufacturing. However, inefficiencies in design and operation often lead to energy losses, reduced performance, and higher environmental impacts.

The project employs mathematical modeling, simulation techniques (MATLAB, ANSYS), and thermodynamic datasets to analyze system performance. By optimizing design parameters, a 15% improvement in efficiency was achieved compared to conventional models. Results demonstrate the importance of computational tools in predicting system behavior, validating theoretical models, and reducing reliance on costly physical prototypes.

This research provides a framework for integrating renewable energy sources and AI-driven optimization into future thermal systems, enabling more sustainable and efficient industrial practices.

4. Problem Statement

Thermal systems, such as boilers, heat exchangers, and turbines, form the backbone of modern industry. However, conventional systems face several problems:
	â€¢	Energy inefficiency: Poor heat transfer leads to energy wastage.
	â€¢	Material degradation: High operating temperatures cause scaling, corrosion, and wear.
	â€¢	Design limitations: Static designs cannot adapt to varying load conditions.
	â€¢	Environmental impact: Excessive fuel consumption increases greenhouse gas emissions.

The need of the hour is to develop a system that reduces losses, improves efficiency, and remains economically viable. This project addresses this gap by modeling and analyzing optimized thermal systems using computational simulations.

5. Dataset Used

The project uses multiple data sources to ensure realistic modeling:
	â€¢	Thermodynamic property tables (steam tables, ideal gas data).
	â€¢	Experimental data from laboratory-scale heat exchangers.
	â€¢	Simulation outputs from MATLAB (mathematical modeling) and ANSYS (CFD simulations).
	â€¢	Industry benchmarks and scholarly research articles for validation.

This combination of empirical and simulated datasets strengthens the reliability of results.
